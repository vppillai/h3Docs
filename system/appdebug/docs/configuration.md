# App Debug System Service Configuration
The enabling/ disabling of App Debug System Service library should be done through the MHC. More on how any component wanting to use this library can integrate it into his own component can be found by looking at some of the system services like the MQTT, NET, and Wifi System Service.
Note App Debug System Service component does not have any conifgurations to be done separately. All the configurations need to come via the other components using it.
